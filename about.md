# Who am I?

I am a _second-year PhD student_ in the **World History program** at [Northeastern University](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/history/). 

I am a huge Celtics fan, but all Boston sports are great. I chose my logo because I'm a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

## What is this for?

_Other than vanity_, I'm writing about myself to learn Markdown. I was fortunate to learn much from a GitHub site that [demonstrates Markdown](http://markdown-it.github.io/).

I will also include my **favorite** quote by Michel Foucault (*Two Lectures*, 1976, pg. 76, read [here](https://monoskop.org/images/5/5d/Foucault_Michel_Power_Knowledge_Selected_Interviews_and_Other_Writings_1972-1977.pdf)) 
> For my part, it has struck me that I might have seemed a bit like a whale that leaps to the surface of the water disturbing it momentarily with a tiny jet of spray and lets it be believed, or pretends to believe, or wants to believe, or himself does in fact indeed believe, that down in the depths where no one sees him any more, where he is no longer witnessed nor controlled by anyone, he follows a more profound, coherent and reasoned trajectory.
